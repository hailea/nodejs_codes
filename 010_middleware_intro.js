/**
 Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
 the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s 
 request-response cycle. 
 */
/*
Middelware is anycode that runs (on the server) between getting a request and sending
a response.
Middleware can be used to log details of every request, to authenticate, to parse JSON data, 
and return 404 pages 

 */
/* 
The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, 
executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware. 
*/
/*
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    Execute any code.
    Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    End the request-response cycle.
    Call the next middleware in the stack.
